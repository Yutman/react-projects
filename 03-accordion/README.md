An accordion is a graphical control element comprising a vertically stacked list of items, such as labels or thumbnails.

Each item can be "expanded" or "stretched" to reveal the content associated with that item. Conversely, an item can also be "collapsed" or "closed" to hide its associated content.

This behavior allows multiple items to be condensed into a smaller space, with the user able to expand each item to view more details as needed.

Accordions are commonly used in user interfaces to organize and present a large amount of information in a limited space, improving user experience by making the application or webpage less cluttered and more navigable.

Accordions are especially useful for:
FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions) sections, where questions are listed, and answers can be revealed by expanding each question.
Form sections, to break down long forms into more manageable, logically grouped sections.
Navigation menus, to categorize options or links, so the user can expand the category they're interested in.

Hooks in React are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components. 
They were introduced in React 16.8 to enable state and other React features without writing a class. 
The most commonly used hooks are useState for managing state, useEffect for side effects, and useContext for accessing the context API.
Hooks allow for cleaner and more concise function components, encourage reusable code, and make it easier to follow the flow of a component's logic.
Below are react projects based on the hooks I've learned and here I effectively apply them.
